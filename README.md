# FarmerLog AI

Farm management vessel — crop tracking, livestock management, field operations, weather impact, yield records, market prices, and AI-powered chat. Built on Cloudflare Workers.

## Architecture

- **Cloudflare Worker** (`src/index.ts`) — API server with in-memory data store and SSE chat proxy
- **Farm Tracker** (`src/farm/tracker.ts`) — `CropManager`, `LivestockTracker`, `FieldOperations`, `WeatherImpact`, `YieldTracker`, `MarketPriceMonitor`
- **UI** (`public/app.html`) — Single-page earthy dashboard (green `#15803D`, brown `#78350F`, sky blue `#38BDF8`)
